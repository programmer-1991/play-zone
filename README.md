## Deployment

**Create a new project:**
- Open your GitHub repository in a new IDE workspace.
- Use pip3 to install Django version ~=4.2.1 as it is the    
  long-term supported (LTS) version of the Django package at this moment. <mark>pip3 install Django~=4.2.1</mark>
- Freeze the packages to the requirements file using pip3.<mark>pip3 freeze local > requirements.txt</mark>
- Create a new project named codestar using the appropriate Django command with a dot at the end to signify the current directory level <mark>django-admin startproject codestar .</mark>
---
**Create a new app:**
- Create a new app named my_app using the appropriate Django command. <mark>python3 manage.py startapp my_app</mark>
- Add the new app to the list of installed apps in the settings.py file.
 
**Create the Heroku app:**
- Navigate to https://www.heroku.com
- Create an account and log in
- Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.
- Click on the Settings tab and reveal the config vars.
- Add a key of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and a value of 1 and click Add.
- This step prevents Heroku from uploading static files, such as CSS and JS, during the build.
---
**Update your code for deployment:**
- Install a production-ready webserver for Heroku using the command <mark>pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1</mark>
- Add gunicorn==20.1.0 to the requirements.txt file using the command: <mark>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</mark>
- Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project(same directory as requirements.txt).
- In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command <mark>web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi</mark> to execute your Django project and start the server.
   This assumes your project is named my_project.
- Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False. and append the '.herokuapp.com' hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
- Git add, commit, and push the code to your GitHub repo.
---
**Create PostgreSQL instance:**
- Navigate to [PostgreSQL from Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/)
- Enter your student email address in the input field provided
- Click Submit and wait while the database is created 
- When your database is successfully created, review the email sent to your student email inbox
---
**connect database to code:**
- Set back debug value to 'True' to ease debugging during development
- Create a file named env.py at the top level project using the command <mark>touch env.py</mark> in the terminal
- Open the .gitignore file and add env.py to prevent the secret data you will add to it from being pushed to GitHub
- In your newly created env.py file, import Python's operating system module using <mark>import os</mark> 
- Set the value of the DATABASE_URL constant to the URL in the email you received from PostgreSQL from Code Institute <mark>os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your-database-URL")</mark>
- Pip install the two packages required to connect to your PostgreSQL database using <mark>pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg2~=2.9</mark> command, then add them to the requirements file using <mark>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</mark> command
- In my_project/settings.py, import the appropriate packages to connect the settings.py file to the env.py file by adding:<br>
<mark>import os<br>
import dj_database_url<br>
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env</mark>
- Next in the settings.py file, we need to comment out the local sqlite3 database connection.
- Then, in the settings.py file, connect to the environment variable DATABASE_URL you previously added to the env.py file by adding: <br><mark>DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}</mark>
- Now that your project is connected to the database, you can create database tables with Django's migrate command <mark>python3 manage.py migrate</mark>
---

**Enter your first data in the database:**
- As Django comes with built-in auth and admin apps we can create a superuser with admin access to our database using the command:
<mark>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</mark>
Choose a memorable user name, use your email address and choose a secure password.
---

**Connect Heroku to PostgreSQL database:**
- Navigate to the Heroku dashboard and return to settings
- Click on <mark>Reveal Config Vars</mark> and add a new config var with a key of <mark>DATABASE_URL</mark>
- Assign to it a value of the URL you received in your email from the Code Institute Postgres Database Server and then click on <mark>Add</mark>
- Now your PostgreSQL cloud database is connected to your deployed app.
---
**Connect to Cloudianry API:**
- Install the Python packages required to connect to the Cloudinary API <mark>pip3 install cloudinary~=1.36.0 dj3-cloudinary-storage~=0.0.6 urllib3~=1.26.15</mark>
- Add these package versions to the requirements.txt file. <mark>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</mark>
- Click the provided link to sign up for[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free)
- Provide your name and email address and choose a password or sign in with a social account. 
- If asked, How would you best describe yourself? you can click on Developer.
- Depending on your chosen sign-up method, you may have to respond to an email 
  verification. 
- In the Cloudinary dashboard, copy the CLOUDINARY_URL.
- Open the env.py file and set the value of the CLOUDINARY_URL constant to the URL you copied from the Cloudinary dashboard.
<mark>os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "URL copied from Cloudinary in last step")</mark>
- Delete the CLOUDINARY_URL= from the start of the URL string, as we are using the setdefault() method rather than assigning the value.
- Open the my_project/settings.py file and add the apps to INSTALLED_APPS, 'cloudinary_storage' and 'cloudinary'

**Update the blog app to use Cloudinary:**
- Open the app/models.py and import the CloudinaryField from the cloudinary/models.py file.
- Also, in the app/models.py file, add a new field to the specific model to store an image.
- As we have added a new model field, we must run makemigrations to create a new migrations file. <mark>python3 manage.py makemigrations</mark>
- Now, migrate the app migrations file to make the changes to the database schema. <mark>python3 manage.py migrate</mark>
---
**Deploy to Heroku:**
- Add the environment variable <mark>SECRET KEY</mark> to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings tab for security reasons.
- Link the secure key in env.py to the settings.py SECRET_KEY variable with the following code: <mark>SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')</mark>
- Set debug to <mark>FALSE</mark>
- Now, let's return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the Deploy tab.
- In the Deployment method section enable GitHub integration by clicking on Connect to GitHub.
- Below you can search for your GitHub repo and connect it to the Heroku app.
- Scroll down and Manually deploy the main branch of this GitHub repo.
- In your new appâ€™s resources tab, ensure you are using an eco dyno and delete any Postgres database Add-on.
- Click on <mark>Open app</mark> to open the rendered webpage(deployed project).
---

### Fork the Repository:
By forking the GitHub Repository, you can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. To implement that follow these steps below:

- Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.
- Locate the Repository. Note! the repository is at https://github.com/programmer-1991/play-zone
- At the top right of the repository page, click "Fork" to create a copy in your own GitHub repository.
---

**Clone the Repository:**
When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Creating a clone allows you to have a local copy of the project. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to https://github.com/programmer-1991/play-zone
- Click the green "Code" button at the top right.
- Select the "Clone by HTTPS" option and copy the web URL to the clipboard.
- Open your code editor or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run `git clone` followed by the copied URL.
- Press enter, and Git will clone the repository to your local machine.
